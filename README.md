# Progress

**Progress** is a simple app that creates reports based on data from chats. It can display the daily, weekly, monthly, and annual statistics.

It shows the following information:

- **Ratings**
- **Chatting time**
- [Response Time](https://docs.livechatinc.com/rest-api/#chats-first-response-time)

# App setup

## Before you start

To use this application in your LiveChat dashboard, you'll need to create your own app in [Developers Console](https://developers.livechatinc.com/console) and get your **Client Id**.

## Getting started

1. Go to [Apps](https://developers.livechatinc.com/console/apps) in [Developers Console](https://developers.livechatinc.com/console).
2. Click **New App** and give it an **App Name**.
3. Choose the **LiveChat** product as the product you want to build for.
4. Go to **Building Blocks**.
5. Add **App Authorization** and mark it as _JavaScript App_. Your **Client Id** will be displayed there.
6. Add `reports_read` scope to the **App scopes and API access** box.
7. Fetch the **Progress** app repository.
8. In the app directory, do the following steps :

   - Install dependencies (`npm install`).
   - In your project, go to `src/utils/congif.js` and replace `client_id` with your own **Client Id** (the one from **Step 5**).
   - Run your app (`npm start`).

9. Add your app url (for example: `https://localhost:3000`) in these two locations:

   - **Redirect URI whitelist**
   - **Agent App Widgets**

10. In **Private installation**, click **Install app**.

You should now be able to use **Progress** with LiveChat.

# How it works

[Agent App Widgets](https://developers.livechat.com/docs/extending-agent-app) are web applications loaded inside the LiveChat Agent App. All agents can interact with the widget during chats with customers. The widget itself is displayed in the Agentâ€™s App right sidebar.

To get information such as **chat ratings** and **chat response time**, you need to use [Reports API](https://developers.livechat.com/docs/data-reporting/reports-api).

In order to pull data from our server, you need to include an **access_token** in all the requests. You can get it using [Personal Access Tokens](https://developers.livechat.com/docs/authorization/agent-authorization#personal-access-tokens) and [JavaScript Widget API](https://docs.livechatinc.com/agent-app-widgets/#javascript-api).

You should also get familiar with [Authorization](https://docs.livechatinc.com/authorization/).
